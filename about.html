                      <h3>What Is Ladies Circle?</h3>
                        <p>Ladies Circle is a club that exists to offer the best opportunity possible for young women to connect, have a great time and give something back. Though the club was established in a different time, the original aims and principles remain as relevant today as ever.
Considering the modern, fresh attitude of Circlers, it often comes as a surprise to new members that Ladies Circle has been around for 80 years.
The first group, Bournemouth No. 1 Circle, first met in 1932 as a social group for the wives of Round Tablers. Now entirely modernised, the club is still going strong and stands as a testament to how Ladies Circle has moved with the times.
                          <br>
                          <b>A National Movement</b>
                          <br>
Eight more circles followed in 1936 in Manchester, Hastings, Liverpool, Doncaster, Middlesborough, Wolverhampton and Southampton, and soon after the national association was formed, under the guidance of first president, Win Hussey.
Then World War II hit, and Ladies Circle struggled to keep going. But it did survive, thanks to Edina Headon who kept the movement going and, leading from 1939 to 1948, is to this day Ladies Circle’s longest serving National President.
                          <br>
                          <b>Going International</b>
                          <br>
In 1947 Ladies Circle went international, with Great Britain & Ireland helping to set up Circles in Denmark and Sweden. This led to the founding of the Ladies Circle International organisation in 1958 to bring together Circlers from across the globe.
Later that year, to celebrate 21 years of Ladies Circle, the national executive decided to adopt Imperial Cancer Research as the Ladies Circle national charity. The first donation was £6,607, and we continued to support the charity as our national cause up until 2013 - which itself has modernised and is now known as Cancer Research UK – raising hundreds of thousands of pounds. Clubs now focus on raising funds for their own local causes.
                          <br>
                          <b>Opening Up to a New Century</b>
                          <br>
In the 1990s Ladies Circle opened up its membership to all women. We remain proud of our roots, and are still part of the Round Table family, but we have transformed into a unique, truly open organisation that welcomes ALL women aged between 18 and 45.
We hope you’ll help us build on our history, and we put everything we’ve learned over the years into making sure Ladies Circle remains an open, supportive and exciting environment for women everywhere – women like you! <br>

                              Ladies Circle means so much that its really difficult to sum it up into a few words. I have met so many people, learnt so many things, took part in so much activities, and laughed and cried and smiled. Ladies Circle is a big, bright, colourful jigsaw. One their one the pieces, are just nice little pieces, but put them together and you achieve a wonderful picture of life!

                              The Ladies Circle family is something that I grew up in. I have lots of happy
                              childhood memories of attending local and regional events with my parents who
                              were in Ladies Circle & Round Table.
                              <br><br>
                              Now I’m a member myself and I love being part of an network of women who support
                              each other and contribute positively to their local, national and international
                              communities. I’ve made some great friends and had lots of fun trying new
                              activities (even slightly improving my terrible craft skills!), but also helped
                              to raise funds for some great local and national charities.
                              <br><br>
                              Everyone is so nice and friendly, it feels like I’ve known them forever!
                              It’s really helped me find my own identity again and have some ‘me-time’ after
                              having children and losing myself in the chaos of parenthood.
                              <br><br>
                              During the current situation our regular virtual meetings have kept my spirits
                              up - we have shared the highs and lows of Lockdown as well as some useful
                              resources for things like homeschooling, and I always end our catch ups feeling
                              more positive and recharged.
